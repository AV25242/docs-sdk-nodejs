== Creating a Simple FTS Index

To replicate the `index-hotel-description` FTS index that is used in the code example above, we use the Couchbase Server Web UI, navigate to the Search tab to "Add Index". Select `travel-sample` bucket from the dropdown and set the "Type Identifier" to (JSON type field) adding a value of `type`.

Then we "Add Type Mapping" entering a new name of `hotel` and selecting "inherit" from the "default analyzer" dropdown and hit "ok".

With that in place, we can hover over the "hotel" type mapping we just created and click the "+" button and select "Insert Child Field". Add the field value of `description` of type "text" and this populates searchable as `description`. We again select "inherit" from the "default analyzer" dropdown and check all of the field checkboxes.

Next, we click the "+" button to "Insert Child Field" and add the field `name` of type "text" searchable as `name`. Again selecting "inherit" from the "default analyzer" dropdown and also selecting all field checkboxes.

Selecting "Create Index" to finalize our changes. Then We also unchecked the "default" Type mapping as we don't want to scan all types. The index should look like the following:

All simple query types are created in the same manner, some have additional properties, which can be seen in common query type descriptions.

Couchbase FTS's xref:6.5@server:fts:fts-query-types.adoc[range of query types] enable powerful searching using multiple options, to ensure results are just within the range wanted.

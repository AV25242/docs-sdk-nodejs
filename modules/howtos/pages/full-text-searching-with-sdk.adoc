= Full Text Search (FTS) Using the Node.js SDK with Couchbase Server
:navtitle: Searching from the SDK
:page-topic-type: howto


[abstract]
You can use the Full Text Search service (FTS) to create queryable full-text indexes in Couchbase Server.


Full Text Search or FTS allows you to create, manage, and query full text indexes on JSON documents stored in Couchbase buckets.
It uses natural language processing for querying documents, provides relevance scoring on the results of your queries, and has fast indexes for querying a wide range of possible text searches.
Some of the supported query types include simple queries like Match and Term queries; range queries like Date Range and Numeric Range; and compound queries for conjunctions, disjunctions, and/or boolean queries.
The Node.js SDK exposes an API for performing FTS queries which abstracts some of the complexity of using the underlying REST API.


// As of Couchbase Server 6.5, FTS...

== Examples

Search queries are executed at the cluster level (not bucket or collection).
Here is a simple MatchQuery that looks for the text “swanky” using a defined index:

----


All simple query types are created in the same manner, some have additional properties, which can be seen in common query type descriptions.
Couchbase FTS's xref:6.5@server:fts:fts-query-types.adoc[range of query types] enable powerful searching using multiple options, to ensure results are just within the range wanted.
Here is a date range query that looks for dates between 1st January 2019 and 31st January:

A conjunction query contains multiple child queries; its result documents must satisfy all of the child queries:

== Working with Results

As with all query result types in the Node.js SDK, the search query results
object contains two properties.  The hits reflecting the documents that
matched your query, which are emitted as rows. Along with the metadata
available in the meta property.  
Metdata holds additional information not directly related to your query, 
such as success total hits and how long the query took to execute in the cluster.

== Consistency

Like the majority of Couchbase query services, FTS allows `RequestPlus` queries --
_Read-Your-Own_Writes (RYOW)_ consistency, ensuring results contain information from
updated indexes:

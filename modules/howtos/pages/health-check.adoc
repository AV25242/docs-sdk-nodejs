= Diagnosing and preventing Network Problems with Health Check
:navtitle: Healtch Check

[abstract]
In today's distributed and virtual environments, users will often not have full administrative control over their whole network. 
Health Check introduces _Ping_ to check nodes are still healthy, and to force idle connections to be kept alive in environments with eager shutdowns of unused resources.
_Diagnostics_ requests a report from a node, giving instant health check information.


Working in distributed environments is _hard_.
Latencies come and go, so do connections in their entirity.
Is it a network glitch, or is the remote cluster down?
Sometimes just knowing the likely cause is enough to get a good start on a workaround, or at least avoid hours wasted on an inappropriate solution.

Health Check enables useful diagnostics on the state of Couchbase Clusters across networks.

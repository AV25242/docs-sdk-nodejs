[#tracing_nodejs]
== Threshold Logging in the Node.js SDK

Response Time Observability is implemented as Threshold Logging in the Node.js SDK from release 2.5.0.

.Threshold Logging Tracer Properties
[#threshold-logging-tracer-ref-nodejs]
|===
| Setting name | Description | Default Value

| `enable_tracing`
| Boolean used to determine tracing is enabled.
Defaults to using the `ThesholdLoggingTracer` if enabled.
When false a Noop or similar tracing implementation should be used instead.
Also when enabled the SDK will try and retrieve duration metrics from the server for KV operations.
| true

| `tracing_threshold_queue_flush_interval`
| The interval between executions that process the collected operation spans.
Expressed in seconds with fractions (or microseconds for `lcb_cntl`).
| 10.0 seconds (or 10000000 microseconds)

| `tracing_threshold_queue_size`
| The maximum number of items to keep in internal queue per service.
| 128

| `tracing_threshold_kv`
| The KV operation operation threshold.
Expressed in seconds with fractions (or microseconds for `lcb_cntl`).
| 0.5 second (500000 microseconds)

| `tracing_threshold_view`
| The View query operation threshold.
Expressed in seconds with fractions (or microseconds for `lcb_cntl`).
| 1 second (1000000 microseconds)

| `tracing_threshold_n1ql`
| The N1QL query operation threshold.
Expressed in seconds with fractions (or microseconds for `lcb_cntl`).
| 1 second (1000000 microseconds)

| `tracing_threshold_fts`
| The FTS query operation threshold.
Expressed in seconds with fractions (or microseconds for `lcb_cntl`).
| 1 second (1000000 microseconds)

| `tracing_threshold_analytics`
| The Analytics query operation threshold.
Expressed in seconds with fractions (or microseconds for `lcb_cntl`).
| 1 second (1000000 microseconds)

| `tracing_orphaned_queue_flush_interval`
| The interval between executions that processes the collected operation spans.
Expressed in seconds with fractions (or microseconds for `lcb_cntl`).
| 10.0 seconds (or 10000000 microseconds)

| `tracing_orphaned_queue_size`
| The maximum number of items to keep in internal queue per service.
| 128

[#customizing]
== Customizing

You can customise Tracer settings through the connection string, or using [.api]`lcb_cntl`.
Here is an example on how to customize our default tracer to reduce the time interval when the information gets logged:

[source,nodejs]
----
var cluster = new couchbase.Cluster("couchbase://127.0.0.1/default?tracing_threshold_queue_flush_interval=10.0");
----

Follow along with our example of xref:tracing-from-the-sdk.adoc[Tracing from the Node.js SDK with Couchbase Server], to discover how to use tracing in the node.js SDK for Response Time Observability.

To get started with the SDK, install it on your computer and then try a simple example, Hello Couchbase.

The Hello Couchbase app shows how to perform some simple database operations.

== Installing the Node.js SDK

Installing Couchnode is similar to installing most other Node.js modules.
Use npm to install the [.api]`couchbase` module:

[source,bash]
----
$ npm install couchbase
----

NOTE: On non-Windows platforms, you must have https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp[node-gyp^] installed and a build environment available because the Couchbase SDK module takes advantage of V8 add-on capabilities (written in C/C++).
On Windows, the module comes with prebuilt libraries.

// Although the Node.js SDK can be used as a standalone library, we suggest it be used with our ___child?___ ODM library known as Ottoman.

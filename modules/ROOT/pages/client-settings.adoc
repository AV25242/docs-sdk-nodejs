= Client Settings Using the Node.js SDK with Couchbase Server
:navtitle: Client Settings

[abstract]
The node.js SDK may be configured using the connection string when instantiating a [.api]`Bucket` object.

In addition to the connection string, the [.api]`Bucket` object offers a few object attributes which can be used to configure settings during runtime:

* `operationTimeout` for key-value operation timeouts (equivalent to `operation_timeout` in the connection string)
* `viewTimeout` to adjust the timeout for MapReduce queries
* `n1qlTimeout` to adjust the timeout for N1QL queries

The unsupported [.api]`Bucket._cntl` and [.api]`Bucket._cntlstring` may be used to modify additional runtime settings which do not have a native Python interface.

Below follows the C settings section:

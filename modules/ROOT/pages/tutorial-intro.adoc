[abstract]
The Couchnode tutorial shows you how to build a simple web application that uses Couchbase Server as the underlying data source.

The sample application works with data in the `beer-sample` bucket.
That's the same sample bucket you used in the Hello Couchbase example.
If you didn't run the Hello Couchbase example, make sure the `beer-sample` bucket is installed before you start this tutorial.

The sample application displays the beers and breweries in the `beer-sample` bucket.
It also provides methods to edit and manage beers and breweries.

The full https://github.com/couchbaselabs/beersample-node[source code for the Couchnode tutorial^] is available in the beersample-node repository from https://github.com/couchbaselabs[couchbaselabs on GitHub^].
You should read through all of the source code in the sample application because it contains additional code that is not described in this tutorial.

= Setting up logging
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
The Node.js SDK does not currently have any built logging available.

You can set the environment variable [.param]`LCB_LOGLEVEL` to various levels from 0 (none - default) to 5 (debug level) to have varying levels of debug output sent to the console from the C SDK that is used internally by the Node.js SDK.

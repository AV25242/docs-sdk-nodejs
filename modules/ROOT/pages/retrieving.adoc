= Retrieving documents
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
You can retrieve documents by using regular reads or replica reads.

== Regular reads

You perform regular reads by using the `get()` method.
Regular reads enable you to retrieve a previously stored document from your active data set.

The following example shows a regular read:

[source,javascript]
----
var myBucket = myCluster.openBucket();
myBucket.get(‘document_name’, function(err, res) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(‘operation failed’, err);
    /*
    operation failed { [Error: The key already exists in the server.] code: 12 }
    */
    return;
  }
  console.log(‘success!’, res);
});
----

Sample output from the example:

----
success! { cas: { '0': 2565341184, '1': 3756057754 } }
----

== Replica reads

You perform replica reads by using the `getReplica()` method.
Replica reads enable you to retrieve a previously stored document by querying the replica copies of this document rather than the active one.
This is not guaranteed to be consistent, but does permit a level of recovery in case the primary server is not reachable.

= Handling errors
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
All asynchronous methods within the SDK utilize the Node.js standard of the end-user.

These mathods provide a callback function where the first parameter is an `Error` object to hold any exceptions that occur while the operation is being performed.
No functions within the SDK should throw `Error` objects at any time.
In addition, all `Error` objects produced by the Node.js SDK include a `code` property that can be used to quickly match and handle the error.

The most common errors that occur are errors relating to keys existing when they shouldn't or not existing when they should.
In addition to these common errors, connection or timeout related errors might occur.
For more information about these, see xref:handling-timeouts.adoc[Handling timeouts] .
